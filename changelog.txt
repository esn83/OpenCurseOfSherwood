#5 2023-04-28
- added changelog.
- game only runs at 60 fps now for simplicity. i've been experimenting with gaffers and dewitters game loops
  and they just add a lot of complexity to the game without bringing much to the table for a game this small.
  i'm especially having trouble with lost keyboard inputs with those loops and haven't found a solution yet.
- fixed a bug where a dead player could reflect bullets with shield.
- all pos_x, pos_y and speed are now float instead of int.
- made swamp a bit more lenient.
- added default unit move speed in data class. all units use this speed now. easier for tweaking speeds.
- it's now the weapon class that shoots a bullet, not the unit class.
- hitboxes are now auto-generated from pos_x, pos_y and texture size.

#6 2023-05-04
- direction east west north south and left right up down were mixed. it's all left right up down now.
- sprite direction now comes from it's update. default direction is "L".
- unit now gets direction from constructor and passes it to sprite with update.
- map images renamed from 1,2,3,... to 001,002,003,...
- bullet image names was missing the _left_ indicator which is now added.
- sprites should now be able to handle up and down images if available. at the moment it must have a set of 'left' images to work.
- a separate terrain hitbox added to unit to make movement more smooth while still having a hitbox for bullets almost as big as the sprite.
- the swamp map now opens when aquired by the hermit.
- moved all the code files except app_entry.cs into /code folder.

#7 2023-05-07

- changed the last swamp area a bit to better fit the map.

#8 2023-06-21
- trying out sublime text editor and git thus the 'test' commit.

- note : the x key grants extra lives if in need. i know i often am ;)
