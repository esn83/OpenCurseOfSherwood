#5 2023-04-28
- added changelog.
- game only runs at 60 fps now for simplicity. i've been experimenting with gaffers and dewitters game loops
  and they just add a lot of complexity to the game without bringing much to the table for a game this small.
  i'm especially having trouble with lost keyboard inputs with those loops and haven't found a solution yet.
- fixed a bug where a dead player could reflect bullets with shield.
- all pos_x, pos_y and speed are now float instead of int.
- made swamp a bit more lenient.
- added default unit move speed in data class. all units use this speed now. easier for tweaking speeds.
- it's now the weapon class that shoots a bullet, not the unit class.
- hitboxes are now auto-generated from pos_x, pos_y and texture size.

#6 2023-05-04
- direction east west north south and left right up down were mixed. it's all left right up down now.
- sprite direction now comes from it's update. default direction is "L".
- unit now gets direction from constructor and passes it to sprite with update.
- map images renamed from 1,2,3,... to 001,002,003,...
- bullet image names was missing the _left_ indicator which is now added.
- sprites should now be able to handle up and down images if available. at the moment it must have a set of 'left' images to work.
- a separate terrain hitbox added to unit to make movement more smooth while still having a hitbox for bullets almost as big as the sprite.
- the swamp map now opens when aquired by the hermit.
- moved all the code files except app_entry.cs into /code folder.

#7 2023-05-07
- added swamp spirits.
- changed the last swamp area a bit to better fit the map.

#8 2023-06-21
- trying out sublime text editor and git thus the 'test' commit.
- made f-elixir protect against the virus-looking swamp spirits as the swamp is painful enough as it is.
- note : the x key grants extra lives if in need. i know i often am ;)

#9 2023-07-18
- fixed a bug where the cross would spawn every time the scene was loaded.

#10 2023-08-03
- changed the game to support different resolutions. in the menu.cs file at the bottom different game_screen_w and game_screen_h can be chosen. default is 800x600.
  the game will always scale according to game_screen_w maintaining 4:3 aspect ratio.
- implemented score system. enemys give 50 points. killing npc's have a penalty of -100 points. time penalty of 1 point/sec to promote speed. at game end each extra life gives 50 bonus points.
- the support for higher resolutions has completely broken the terrain colission detection so it is disabled for now - don't cheat! :p
- added f1 to menu screen for toggling view of poem guide and controls overview.
